## Objective

Design an interactive quiz that uses an existing API for questions and answers.
The project should run in a CLI, deployed via Heroku, using Python.

***The needs within this project are not genuine and are made purely
for the purpose of completing my Code Institute project***

---

## Brief

The goal of this site is to provide an interactive quiz with increasing
difficulty levels. The final product should:

- be programmatically error free
- be written using Python
- have a varied question base to allow replayability
- handle all user input errors gracefully and appropriately
- give clear instructions regarding use and valid inputs
