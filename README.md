## Objective

The objective is to write a programme which calculates the travel costs that can be expected going to a certain country, for a certain time and at a certain level of comfort.
The project should run in a CLI, deployed via Heroku, using Python.

***The needs within this project are not genuine and are made purely
for the purpose of completing my Code Institute project***

---

## Brief

The goal of this programme is to provide knowledge of what costs can be expected for a travel (excluding the initial transportation by bus, train, airplain etc. to arrive there and get back). The final version of this programme should:

- be programmatically error free
- be written using Python
- have a database for >100 countries
- handle all user input errors gracefully and appropriately
- give clear instructions regarding use and valid inputs

## UX &#8722; User Experience Design

### User Requirements

#### First Time User
<ul>
  <li>as a first time user I am interested in the travel costs that I can expect on a daily basis as well as for the whole length of my travel</li>
  <li>as a programmer I would like to be able to provide a clear, useful and easy to use programme</li>
</ul>

#### Returning User
<ul>
  <li>as a returning User I am interested in financially planning the upcoming travel</li>
  <li>as a frequent traveller I maybe will want to compare the travel costs in different countries</li>
</ul>

#### Interested Party
<ul>
  <li>as someone who is interested in how the programme functions, I want to see how the code was written, what the data source is and how the user inputs are validated </li>
</ul>


### Initial Concept

The first idea came up when I was thinking about the question how many days I could spend in a specific country with a certain budget. I was interested in such a calculation because I was in this situation in the beginning of this year. Thinking through the idea of writing a python programme that answers this question, I reason that most people normally have a certain amount of time available and want to know the budget they need, rather than having endless time and a certain budget. So here we are, now there is a programme telling you roughly how much budget you can expect for your next travel. The data will of course not be accurate for each individual person, but it can be a start and help planning.
