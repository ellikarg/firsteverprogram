## BUGS

### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | One bug that I spent a lot of time fixing on was that the gallery pictures would overlap the h3-headings when displayed in the grid with only one column (for small screens) | In the end I managed to fix it with a really good hint from my mentor: using the dev tools to make a border around each div-container of the grid-structure and then consequently checking all margin- and padding- and gap-values for the different screen sizes and how they behave when changed from one to another. |
